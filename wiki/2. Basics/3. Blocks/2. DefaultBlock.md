# Default Block Class
The DefaultBlock class is a basic block class that provides more support than the vanilla block class. It is designed to reduce the amount of classes required for simple blocks or to be extended by developers to create custom blocks with specific functionality.

Using the DefaultBlock class is described in [Basic Block Classes](1.%20Basic%20Block%20Classes.md#usage).

## Features
The DefaultBlock class provides the following features:
- [Shape support](#shape-support)
- [Sound support](#sound-support)

## Shape Support
The DefaultBlock class provides support for block shapes when instantiating the class without requiring to extend it. The shape is defined by a VoxelShape object passed to the constructor.

### Usage
```java
new DefaultBlock(Block.Properties.of(), Shapes.box(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1))
```
This uses the constructor overload which takes block properties and a VoxelShape object as the second parameter. 

The shape can be defined by a single box of a collection of boxes, for which I recommend using a method instead of defining it inline.
```java

// Code omitted: 
// 
// the registration of the block, this is only the block constructor passed to the regiser function
// this is for clearity and to show the block creation
new DefaultBlock(Block.Properties.of(), this::createShapeForExample);

// Create a shape for a block
public static VoxelShape createShapeForExample() {
    // shape would be simular to a stair block
    return ShapeHelper.getShapeFromAABB(
        new AABB(0, 0, 0, 1, .5, 1),
        new AABB(0, .5, 0, .5, 0, 1)
    );
}
```
*Note the use of ShapeHelper this a class supplied by the KOWI Core, you can read more [here](../../3.%20Helpers/1.%20ShapeHelper.md)*

## Sound Support
The DefaultBlock class provides support for block sounds when instantiating the class without requiring to extend it. The sound is defined by a SoundType object passed to the constructor.






## Combining Features
All the blocks in the KOWI Core have constructors with all the overloads you require.
- Basic Constructor: `new DefaultBlock(Block.Properties)`
- Shape Constructor: `new DefaultBlock(Block.Properties, VoxelShape)`
- Shape supplier Constructor: `new DefaultBlock(Block.Properties, Supplier<VoxelShape>)`
- Sound Constructor: `new DefaultBlock(Block.Properties, SoundType)`
- Sound and Shape Constructor: `new DefaultBlock(Block.Properties, SoundType, VoxelShape)`
- Sound and Shape supplier Constructor: `new DefaultBlock(Block.Properties, SoundType, Supplier<VoxelShape>)`

## Example
A full example of the DefaultBlock class can be found below:
```java
/**
 * An example of a mod block register class using the KOWI Core's BlockRegister class
 */
public class ModBlocks {
    
    // Defining the block register as a static final field
    static final BlockRegister BLOCKS = new BlockRegister(TestingCore.MODID, ModItems.ITEMS);

    // Register blocks here 

    // Example of using the default block to easily add a simple block without the hassle of creating a new class
    public static final RegistryObject<Block> EXAMPLE_BLOCK = BLOCKS.register("example_block", () -> new DefaultBlock(Block.Properties.of().strength(3.0F, 3.0F)));

    // Example of using the default block to easily add a simple block without the hassle of creating a new class
    public static final RegistryObject<Block> EXAMPLE_SHAPE_BLOCK = BLOCKS.register("example_shape_block", () -> new DefaultBlock(Block.Properties.of().strength(3.0F, 3.0F), createShapeForExample()));
    
    // Example of using the default block to easily add a simple block without the hassle of creating a new class
    public static final RegistryObject<Block> EXAMPLE_SOUND_BLOCK = BLOCKS.register("example_sound_block", () -> new DefaultBlock(Block.Properties.of().strength(3.0F, 3.0F), SoundType.AMETHYST));

    // Create a shape for a block
    public static VoxelShape createShapeForExample() {
        // shape would be simular to a stair block
        return ShapeHelper.getShapeFromAABB(
            new AABB(0, 0, 0, 1, .5, 1),
            new AABB(0, .5, 0, .5, 0, 1)
        );
    }

    // Register the blocks to the event bus, similar to how you would do it normally
    public static void register(IEventBus eventBus) {
        BLOCKS.register(eventBus);
    }
}
```
