# Basic Block Classes 
The KOWI Core provides several basic block classes that can be used to create custom blocks. These classes are designed to reduce the amound of classes required for simple blocks or to be extended by developers to create custom blocks with specific functionality. The basic block classes are as follows:
- [DefaultBlock](2.%20DefaultBlock.md): The default block class offering more support than the vanilla block class, with shape and sound support.
- [ContainerBlock](#containerblock): Similar to the DefaultBlock class, but with blockentity support. without the need to create a new block class.
