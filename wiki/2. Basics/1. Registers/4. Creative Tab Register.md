# Creative Tab Register
The creative tab register is a simple register that can be used to register creative tabs. It is a simple wrapper around the forge creative tab register.

For more information about registers and their structure in general, see the [Registers](1.%20Registers.md) page.

## Creating an Creative Tab Register
Each mod requires it's own instance of the `CreativeTabRegister` as it requires mod specific details.

An example of how to create and setup an creative tab register can be found below:
```java
// Example in ModCreativeTabs

// Defining the creative tab register as a static final field
static final CreativeTabRegister CREATIVE_TABS = new CreativeTabRegister(TestingCore.MODID);

    // Register creative tabs here

// Register the creative tabs to the event bus, similar to how you would do it normally
public static void register(IEventBus eventBus) {
    CREATIVE_TABS.register(eventBus);
}
```
*Example shown is taken from the TestingCore which can be found [here](https://github.com/KOWI2OO3/KOWI-Core/tree/main/TestingCore/src/main/java/io/kowi2003/testing_core/init/ModCreativeTabs.java)*

The `register` method should be called in the mod's main class to register the creative tabs to the event bus. As described in the [Register Use](1.%20Registers.md#register-use) segment of the Registers page.

## Creative tab Registration
Further more the creatve tab registration is done using the `CreativeTabRegister.register` method:

The method for registering creative tabs just requires the tab's id and the supplier for the actual creative tab, this supplier can be made using the builder minecraft supplies or by creating a custom creative tab class if more functionallity is required.
```java
/**
 * register a creative tab
 * @param name the name of the creative tab
 * @param tab the creative tab to add as a supplier
 * @return the registry object for this creative tab
 */
public RegistryObject<CreativeModeTab> register(String name, Supplier<CreativeModeTab> tab)
```

Building on the previous example of the `ModCreativeTabs` class. Calling this method would be done as follows:
```java
// Register creative tabs here

// Example of using the register to easily add a creative tab
public static final RegistryObject<CreativeModeTab> EXAMPLE_TAB = CREATIVE_TABS.register("example_tab", () -> CreativeModeTab.builder()
        .icon(() -> new ItemStack(Blocks.STONE.asItem()))                                 // Defining the icon
            .title(Component.translatable("creative_tab." + TestingCore.MODID + ".base")) // Defining the name
            .displayItems((ItemDisplayParameters, output) -> {
                // Add items to the creative tab
            })
        .build());
```
*Example shown is taken from the TestingCore which can be found [here](https://github.com/KOWI2OO3/KOWI-Core/tree/main/TestingCore/src/main/java/io/kowi2003/testing_core/init/ModCreativeTabs.java)*

## Examples
Example of how to use the creative tab register can be found in the internal TestingCore mod [here](https://github.com/KOWI2OO3/KOWI-Core/tree/main/TestingCore/src/main/java/io/kowi2003/testing_core), which acts as an example of how to use the kowi core in general.
