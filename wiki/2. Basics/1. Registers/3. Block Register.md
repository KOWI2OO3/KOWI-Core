# Block Register
The block register is a simple register that can be used to register blocks. It is a simple wrapper around the forge block register.

For more information about registers and their structure in general, see the [Registers](1.%20Registers.md) page.

## Creating an Block Register
Each mod requires it's own instance of the `BlockRegister` as it requires mod specific details.
The block register requires the mod id as well as a reference to the mod's [ItemRegister](2.%20Item%20Register.md) to automatically register block items.

An example of how to create and setup an block register can be found below:
```java
// Example in ModBlocks

// Defining the block register as a static final field
static final BlockRegister BLOCKS = new BlockRegister(TestingCore.MODID, ModItems.ITEMS);

    // Register blocks here!

// Register the blocks to the event bus, similar to how you would do it normally
public static void register(IEventBus eventBus) {
    BLOCKS.register(eventBus);
}
```
*Example shown is taken from the TestingCore which can be found [here](https://github.com/KOWI2OO3/KOWI-Core/tree/main/TestingCore/src/main/java/io/kowi2003/testing_core/init/ModBlocks.java)*

The `register` method should be called in the mod's main class to register the blocks to the event bus. As described in the [Register Use](1.%20Registers.md#register-use) segment of the Registers page.

## Block Registration
Further more the block registration is done using the `BlockRegister.register` methods:

### Simple block register method
The simple method for registering blocks just requires the block's id and the supplier for the actual block.
```java
public <T extends Block> RegistryObject<T> register(String id, final Supplier<? extends T> block)
```

Building on the previous example of the `ModBlocks` class. Calling this method would be done as follows:
```java
// Register blocks here 

// Example of using the default block to easily add a simple block without the hassle of creating a new class
public static final RegistryObject<Block> EXAMPLE_BLOCK = BLOCKS.register("example_block", () -> new DefaultBlock(Block.Properties.of().strength(3.0F, 3.0F)));
```
*Example shown is taken from the TestingCore which can be found [here](https://github.com/KOWI2OO3/KOWI-Core/tree/main/TestingCore/src/main/java/io/kowi2003/testing_core/init/ModBlocks.java)*


### Block and block item register method
The second register method defined by the `BlockRegister` is a register method which allows the definition of the block item.
```java
public <T extends Block> RegistryObject<T> register(String id, final Supplier<? extends T> block, Function<T, BlockItem> blockItemFunction)
```

Continuing on the example of the `ModBlocks` class. Using this method is simular to calling the normal register method, with the exception of requiring a block item to be defined.
An example of the register call can be found below:
```java
// Register blocks here 

// Example of using the default block to easily add a simple block without the hassle of creating a new class
public static final RegistryObject<Block> EXAMPLE_BLOCK = BLOCKS.register("example_block", () -> new DefaultBlock(Block.Properties.of().strength(3.0F, 3.0F)), block -> new BlockItem(block, new Item.Properties()));
```
*Example shown is taken from the TestingCore which can be found [here](https://github.com/KOWI2OO3/KOWI-Core/tree/main/TestingCore/src/main/java/io/kowi2003/testing_core/init/ModBlocks.java)*

Here you see the block item defined is just the regular block item but this can be any item to define the block by.

## Block Base Classes
The KOWI Core provides a few different base classes for blocks which house for example properties or blockentities, these can be found in [Basics/Blocks](../3.%20Blocks/).

## Examples
Example of how to use the block register can be found in the internal TestingCore mod [here](https://github.com/KOWI2OO3/KOWI-Core/tree/main/TestingCore/src/main/java/io/kowi2003/testing_core), which acts as an example of how to use the kowi core in general.
