# KOWI Core Registers
KOWI Core supplies a set of registers which can be used to register most of the simple concepts, blocks, items, blockentity types, menu's, creative tabs etc. These are a small wrapper around the forge registers which I have always needed to make special methods for to make block registering more convenient. 

## Register use
The registers are all setup in the same way to make a neat and consistent registering experience.

Each register is made of 3 parts.
1. A constructor
    - creating a new instance to be used by each mod with the mod specific details
2. A register(IEventBus bus) method
    - used to tell forge the register needs to be included in the events
3. The regiser method(s) for the element
    - this is what you will use to register your element
<br>

As an example: `ModItems`, as is usually done nowadays; the register defined at the top of the class and the register(IEventBus bus) at the bottom of the class. and the element (in this case item) registers in the middle. 
```java
// Example in ModItems

// Defining the item register as a static final field
static final ItemRegister ITEMS = new ItemRegister(TestingCore.MODID);


    // Register items here!


// Register the items to the event bus, similar to how you would do it normally
public static void register(IEventBus eventBus) {
    ITEMS.register(eventBus);
}
```

With a Mod[Element] class like this you can register these classes in your mod's main class like so:
```java 
@Mod(TestingCore.MODID)
public class TestingCore
{
    // The modid definition of the mod used as a reference
    public static final String MODID = "testing_core";
    
    public TestingCore()
    {
        IEventBus modEventBus = FMLJavaModLoadingContext.get().getModEventBus();

        // Registering blocks and items for the mod just like you would do normally
        ModItems.register(modEventBus);
        ModBlocks.register(modEventBus);
        ModModels.register(modEventBus);

        // Code omitted: 
        // 
        // mod initialization, registering other elements, event registers etc.
    }

    // Code omitted: 
    // 
    // further mod initialization methods, common, server, client start etc.
}
```
*Example showm is taken from the TestingCore which can be found [here](https://github.com/KOWI2OO3/KOWI-Core/tree/main/TestingCore/src/main/java/io/kowi2003/testing_core/TestingCore.java)*

Example form the internal testing mod I use, which acts as an example on how to use the core.

## Different Type of Registers
The KOWI Core defines a few different types of registers, each with their own purpose. The registers are as follows:
- [Item Register](2.%20Item%20Register.md)
- [Block Register](3.%20Block%20Register.md)
- [Creative Tab Register](4.%20Creative%20Tab%20Register.md)

## Examples
Example of how to use the registers can be found in the internal TestingCore mod [here](https://github.com/KOWI2OO3/KOWI-Core/tree/main/TestingCore/src/main/java/io/kowi2003/testing_core), which acts as an example of how to use the kowi core in general.
